This is a relatively straightforward (vanilla JS) solution to recreate the table mentioned in the prompt. My first step was to simply break out the teams from the JSON by using `Object.keys()` to get the team abbreviations, and then with those teams create the column headers for the table. With that done, I then went on to traverse the JSON again to build one complete table row at a time. 

On this traversal I used `Object.entries()` to give me the team name as well as the nested object of results versus the other teams, which I called `versusResults`. The team name was then used as the header row, and since this was traversing the same data in the same direction as getting all teams before, each team's row position should match its column position (BRO is (0,0), BSN is (1,1), etc.) Once the row header was inserted, the nested object was accessed with a for loop to get each column team to fill out the row one by one, for example, `versusResults['BSN']['W']`, but with the team name being the variable passed by the for loop. If the column gave the same team as the row, then "-" would be inserted into the table detail instead. This function was built with the assumption that every team was present in each nested object (except for the same team) and would have broken otherwise, but would remain consistently functional if the team results in the nested object were put into a different order.
