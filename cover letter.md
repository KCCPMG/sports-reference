I've come to software engineering somewhat later in life, but part of what has made that process worthwhile is the possibility of creating and working on projects that excite me and indulge my passions, with sports being very high among them. I've spent a lot of time in the past on your sites, specifically pro-football-reference.com and hockey-reference.com, due to the tremendous raw data presented quickly and simply, as opposed to the less wonderful user interfaces used by the NHL and NFL. I love that that type of information has enabled deep dives on data projects similar to this one which I did back in 2015: https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2015/7/26/9000793/quantifying-the-badness-of-the-2014-wr-passing-game. In fact, the detailed play-by-play information presented on pro-football-reference seems so easy to parse that it has always been a dream of mine to use it to come up with a way of generating play success/failure scores taking into account down, distance, yardage, and field position. I know this isn't an immediately realistic goal, but it's the kind of possibility that has energized me as I've learned and kept an eye to the future, and I would love a chance to be a part of what you guys are building.
